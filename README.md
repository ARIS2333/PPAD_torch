# PPAD_torch
A torch implementation for https://github.com/bozdaglab/PPAD  
The original paper is https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/39/Supplement_1/i149/7210436  
Run PPAD_torch.ipynb  
The Masking layer in keras is substituted by two customized classes and pack_padded_sequence
The parameters need further tuning.


This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of PPAD.  
For more details, refer to the original paper https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/39/Supplement_1/i149/7210436ï¼Œ the original code is also provided in https://github.com/bozdaglab/PPAD.  

To run the implementation, execute the PPAD_torch.ipynb notebook. Note that the Masking layer in Keras has been replaced by two custom classes and the pack_padded_sequence function in PyTorch. The parameters of the model may require further tuning for optimal performance.
